//  2. Add yourself to the database:  15 Points
//  3. Add at least 10 movies you have seen from the movies that are in the database. 
//      (No need to manually add. Just show and execute multiple automated insertions.). 
//      You need to show the movie names. If two students have the exactly same 10 movies listed, 
//      they will each get half of the marks. If there are three, one-third.  And so on.  25 Points
//  4. Run the recommendation result for yourself. Show the movies that are listed: 25 Points
//  5. Run and show the new/changed result of the Page Rank algorithm on the data set. 
//      In your verbal commentary, you must point out the changes that have happened in the order.  25 Points
//  6. Upload the 1 min video. (MP4, MKV, AVI, or any other video format that is compatible with VLC media player 3.0.12 is acceptable). 
//      The filename of the video must be your index number.
